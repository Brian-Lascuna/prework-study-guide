# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A prework study guide webpage to prepare myself for the challenges and topics that will be discussed in the upcoming bootcamp. This webpage is intended to serve as a study guide that I can cultivate as I learn more and more during the bootcamp and hopefully assist other bootcamp members during their journey. A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was learned and applied while developing this webpage.
